# FINISHED PROJECT NOTES:

After some learning on PHP and MySQL, (I have never seen such programming languaje before) I was able to develop this Challenge:

I've found an interesting way to use SQL statements directly in PHP, so way simplified than PostgreSQL with Javascript!!
The challenge funcionality runs smoothly, but I've found a very strange error when I try to run QATest:

<img src="./ADD_ERROR.png" alt="Img not found!">

The QATest reject the project because it's not passing the test related to the "ADD" button needed for the challenge, so instead pass the 12th needed test to PASS the challenge, its only pass 11th;But as you can see in the next image, the button is in there:

<img src="./add.png" alt="Img not found!">

Not to mention the "ADD" button is mandatory for the remaining test pass trough the challenge:

<img src="./qatest.png" alt="Img not found!">

Having no idea why the QATester reject the project, I have start asking for help, on StackOverflow : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70279990/qatester-weird-error-clickable-element-add-was-not-found-by-textcssxpath 
On Google, where i finish reading Selenium WebDriver: https://www.google.com/search?q=selenium+webdriver+clickable+element+add&oq=selenium+webdriver+clickable+element+add&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5368j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 , Asking to my Teachers at HENRY, etc. 


Unfortunately, I've found no answer, so I've decided deliver the project as is it. I hope someone will answer me about this issue, and I'll be able to fix it.
